V2X communication(Vehicle to Everything else): is a communication system that ensures communication between the vehicle and other resources/entities that  can directly or indirectly affect the vehicle. It has different subcomponents depending on the specific type of communication being established. V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle), V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure), V2P (Vehicle to Pedestrians), V2N (Vehicle to Network), V2D (Vehicle to Device) are a few of these subcomponents.
